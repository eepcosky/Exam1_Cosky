9. A. There are two commands that work for this problem:

Unix Command 1: grep -c “>” Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.cds.all.fa
Unix Command 2: grep “>” Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.cds.all.fa | wc -l

Answer: 101,933.

B. Unix Command: wc -l Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.cds.all.fa

Answer: 2,066,758.

C. Yes, the adapter sequence ‘AGATCGG’ is present in the Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.cds.all.fa file.

There are a few commands that work for this problem:

Unix Command 1: grep "AGATCGG" intron_IME_data.fasta | less.
#Is the adapter sequence present or not?

Unix Command 2: grep -c “AGATCGG” Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.cds.all.fa
Unix Command 3: grep “AGATCGG” Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.cds.all.fa | wc -l
#Determining how many multiples of the adapter sequence are present.

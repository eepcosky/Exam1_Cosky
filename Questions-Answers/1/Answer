1. Yes, the ‘ecological modeling of populations of organisms’ should be considered a bioinformatics research area. Through a
bioinformatics analysis of genetic and genomic data of individuals within a population we might explore population ecology by:
(1) evaluating geometic population parameters (i.e., emigration and immigration) that impact gene flow among metapopulation
patches, (2) measuring inbreeding between related individuals in a population by finding sequence similarities among individuals
to estimate inbreeding depression, and (3) assessing whether various haplotype groups or SNPs in a population lead to differential
reproductive success among individuals in that species.

A. A BLASTN is most appropriate because it will compare a nucleotide query sequence against a nucleotide sequence database.

B. When I do the blast to the nr database on NCBI, the search returns 32 hits.
Please note, I optimized for highly similar sequences by implementing the BLAST algorithm, megablast.

C.  Using the taxonomy report, I found nucleotide sequence homologs for the R2R3-MYB gene in 15 species.

D. The top six search results were:

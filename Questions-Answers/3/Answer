3. The E-value provides information about the likelihood that a given sequence match is a result of random chance. Since the
database returns a very low E-value (3.4e-178), it is very unlikely that the database match is the result of random chance and
is therefore more significant. In sum, there is an extremely high confidence level that the database result is homologous.

5. In eukaryotes, there are generally 2-3 genomes per cell. Most eukaryotes have two genomes per cell, including a mitochondrial
and nuclear genome. However, some eukaryotes, such as plants, have three genomes per cell, including a chloroplast, mitochondrial,
and nuclear genomes. In prokaryotes, however, there is generally only 1 circular nuclear genome per cell.
